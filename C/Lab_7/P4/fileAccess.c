/*
Write a program that uses three functions: 
Instructions() is a function that takes no arguments and returns no value but simply 
displays the instructions on what the program does using printf statements.
Average() is a function that takes 3 integer arguments and returns the average of them 
as a floating point number 
Display() is a function that takes one floating point number as an argument and 
displays the value of it. 
Your program should start by 
calling Instructions(), then it should read the integers 
after asking the user for them. 
It should then call the function Average() to find the average of the three numbers. 
Finally, it should display the result by calling the function Display().
